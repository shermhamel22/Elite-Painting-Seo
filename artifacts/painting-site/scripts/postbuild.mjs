// Post-build SEO step:
//   1. Generates a sitemap.xml listing every static and dynamic route.
//   2. Prerenders per-route HTML files (copies of index.html) with route-specific
//      <title>, <meta description>, canonical, OG tags, and JSON-LD baked in,
//      so search engines and social crawlers see fully populated metadata
//      without needing to execute JavaScript.
//   3. Bakes a hidden, accessible text block into the static HTML for each
//      route so LLMs and crawlers that don't run JS can still read the page's
//      core content.
